# Ajax + APIs

## Introduction

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

"Our short online course, aimed at beginners, is designed for people who want to work with APIs (how different websites talk to each other) and Ajax (one way of grabbing and sending that data) together to make remixed projects." - taken from [SuperHi](https://superhi.com)'s short description of the course.

Each project is created as a separate React Component held in the `Pages/` directory and is a separate lesson covering important ajax and or api fundamentals when creating an application. Check their descriptions below for an deeper understanding.

### Learning Objectives

During the course I reinforced:

- How to work with my own data and external data sources
- Making sites that use services like [Figma](https://Figma.com), [Instagram](https://Instagram.com), [Contentful](https://Contentful.com), to make data-driven sites
- How to work with sites without APIs through web scraping.
- 
- Add in subtle and not-so-subtle parallax effects to web designs
- Confidence in web design decisions.

## Projects

### Plant Life

Plant Life is an extremely basic online shop for people who need plants. Currently there is a menu that renders FIVE (5) pages. The Home page features a product set at a cost of $599. The product images separate at random on mouseover and retract to and orderly stack on mouseout. This project makes use of React refs as well as React class based Components instead of Hooks to handle a bug where the menu stays open once you navigate to a page. Additionally, it uses ES6 arrow functions to handle most of the interactivity on the page.

## Getting Started: Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
